# Capstone-project

### Welcome to my project. I have created a maths game with 3 levels. First, you must enter your name. You will then be given a prompt to choose your level, with increasing difficulty. Please enter 1, 2 or 3, depending on your choice of preferred difficulty. You will then be given 10 questions that will be shown to you one by one. If your answer is correct, you will move on to the next question. If your answer is incorrect, you will be given another chance to answer the question, with a 0.5x penalty if you are correct on the second attempt. If both of your answers are incorrct, you will be given the solution to the problem and the code will move on to the next question. After answering the 10 questions, you will be given a percentage score. Finally, you will be asked if you want to play again or not. If you do, then you will be asked to enter your name and level again. If not, the program will end. At the end of your session, the leaderboard will be printed, showing the names and scores of every player in descending order. 

### I hope you enjoy the game!
